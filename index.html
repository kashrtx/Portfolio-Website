      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><b>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Kaushal Bhingaradia, a student at the University of Toronto, and a passionate software developer.
        In my TCS major at University of Toronto, we are exposed to a lot of UI/UX design concepts such as user-centric design and accessibility. 
        This is where we make various projects that showcase our understanding of these concepts through responsive websites, software, Unity games, 
        and UI-related projects. Courses like CCT286 and CCT270 have taught me a great deal about creating accessible and user-centric content.
        I am also majoring in GIS, which has introduced me to more advanced concepts like spatial data analysis, querying with SQL, and Python 
        scripting. This knowledge allows me to build on my skills and create even more advanced projects in the future. I am very creative and love 
        exploring new things to develop various projects.
      </b></p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p><b>
        I love building computers and love experimenting with different large-language-AI-models in order to work more efficiently for advanced
        projects and training them to be smarter. I like to make music and fix broken objects around the house like electronics or mechancial
        objects. I also love to play video games and watch movies.
